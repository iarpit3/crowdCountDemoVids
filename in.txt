Hi Abhishek, Allahbaksh,




 




We have initiated a new Deep Learning Linux 14 p2.8xlarge Amazon ec2 instance.  Attached is the *.pem file to connect to the instance. 




The ip address of the instance is 34.208.106.39 and URL http://ec2-34-208-106-39.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ 




 




Place the pem file in the root folder and using mac Terminal use the following commands to access (we have tested, it works):




chmod 400 Infosysp28xlarge.pem




ssh -i Infosysp28xlarge.pem ubuntu@ec2-34-208-106-39.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com




  




Let me know if you need
